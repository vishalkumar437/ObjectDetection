**Abstract**

With the rise in rapidly increasing population comes the responsibility of feeding it. For this,
it is necessary that the unwanted animals don't ruin crop production. Based on a survey about
30-40% of the production yearly is destroyed by animals that enter the fields and destroy the
crop or walk over them.
Thus it becomes necessary for the farmers to protect their crop production at all
costs.Through our project, we try to detect these animals and discuss various ways of keeping
them away from the farm. We will be making use of inexpensive optical imagery and several
other algorithms.
An object detection algorithm will help in the detection of animals and differentiate them
from humans. The module will detect animals through live video feed and break the video
feed into several frames and will check the presence of cattle in each frame. Upon detection,
we will make use of several frequencies(non-harming) for frightening away the cattle and
other animals which destroy crop production.
